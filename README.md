# Profile Card, Exercise

This is an exercise proposed by a frontend development course that i've been attending as of late, it is based on a similar exercise by frontend mentor.

The main objective of this exercise is the use of flexbox by hands-on practise, it was a great way to discover some flaws with my way of approaching any centralizing problems.
